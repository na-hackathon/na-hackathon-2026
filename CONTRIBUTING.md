# Contributing

Thanks for contributing! This repo is designed to work well during a fast-paced hackathon.

## Ways to contribute

- **Open an issue** for: tasks, bugs, questions, proposals.
- **Submit a pull request** for: docs updates, workflow/code changes, spec drafts.

## Workflow

1. Create an issue (or find one) and comment that you're taking it.
2. Create a branch: `yourname/short-description`
3. Make changes with clear commits.
4. Open a PR and link the issue (e.g., “Closes #123”).

## Review expectations

During the hackathon we aim for fast iteration.

- Small PRs are preferred.
- Ask for review in the PR description or in Slack (and link the PR).

## Do not post

- Personal contact info, travel details, reimbursement info
- Secrets/tokens/credentials

If something sensitive is needed, use the organizer-managed private channel/storage.
